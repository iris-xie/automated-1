### Part 1: Contract for Renting [](https://zufang.ababtools.com/s12#%E4%B8%80%E3%80%81%E7%A7%9F%E6%88%BF%E5%90%88%E5%90%8C%E9%82%A3%E4%BA%9B%E4%BA%8B%E5%84%BF)

| Contract Terms | Explanation | Caution |
|-----------------|--------------|---------|
| Rental Agreement | The tenant receives the property from the landlord and pays rent. | Do not trust oral agreements; always sign a written contract. |
| Key Content | Information about the property, rental period, rent payment methods, repair responsibilities, and default clauses. | Read carefully and ask questions until you fully understand everything. |
| Rental Period | The maximum term is 20 years; after signing, it can be renewed, but the total term cannot exceed 20 years. | Plan your term carefully—too short may cause instability, too long may limit flexibility. |
| Rent Payment | Clarify payment terms and amounts, such as paying one month's rent in advance or two months' rent. | Ensure fairness; do not pay more than you can afford. |
| Repair Responsibilities | Generally, the landlord is responsible for maintaining the main structure of the property, while the tenant covers daily maintenance costs. | Include these details in the contract to avoid disputes. |
| Default Clauses | Rules for handling cases like returning early or defaulting on rent payments. | Ensure the penalty is reasonable; do not be taken advantage of. |
