3.2 Leasing Tactics: Smooth Transfers, No Loose Ends [​](https://zufang.ababtools.com/s10#_3-2-%E8%BD%AC%E7%A7%9F%E5%A6%99%E6%8B%9B-%E8%BD%BB%E6%9D%BE%E6%8D%A2%E5%B7%A2-%E4%B8%8D%E7%95%99%E6%89%8B%E5%B0%BE)

Ah, life, always changing. Maybe you've found a better home, or maybe you're leaving the city and need to move out. If the rental contract allows for subletting or if the landlord gives their blessing, let's discuss the ins and outs of transferring tenancies.

3.2.1 Preparing to Transfer: [​](https://zufang.ababtools.com/s10#_3-2-1-%E8%BD%AC%E7%A7%9F%E5%89%8D%E7%9A%84%E5%87%86%E5%A4%87%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Check the lease: Look through your rental agreement to see if it mentions anything about transferring tenancies. Some contracts will clearly state whether you're allowed to sublet and what conditions must be met.
*   Speak with the landlord: Even if the contract doesn't mention transferring tenancies, don't give up. You can talk to the landlord directly. After all, an empty apartment won't benefit them either, and they might agree.
*   Research laws: To avoid any future complications, it's a good idea to look into the relevant laws. Find out what steps are needed and what you should be cautious about.

3.2.2 Asking for Lease Approval [​](https://zufang.ababtools.com/s10#_3-2-2-%E6%88%BF%E4%B8%9C%E5%A4%A7%E5%A4%A7-%E6%B1%82%E5%90%8C%E6%84%8F)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When asking the landlord to allow a sublease, your tone should be polite and your reasons clear. You can say:

*   “Landlord, because of work changes or finding a more suitable home, I need to transfer my tenancy. Please consider my request.”
*   “I'll find reliable tenants who will pay on time and take good care of the property. I'll make sure they understand the rules so they won't cause me any trouble.”
*   “I'll inform the new tenant about the rental rules so they don’t bothering me.”
