3.2 Leasing Tactics: Smooth Transfers, No Loose Ends

=============================================================================================================================================================================

Ah, life, always changing. Maybe you've found a better home, or maybe you're leaving the city and need to move out. If the rental contract allows for subletting or if the landlord gives their blessing, let's discuss the ins and outs of transferring tenancies.

3.2.1 Preparing to Transfer:
