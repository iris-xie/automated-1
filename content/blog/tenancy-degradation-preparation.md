3.1 Degradation of tenancy: As far as the horizon is concerned, there's an encounter [](https://zufang.ababtools.com/s9#_3-1-%E9%80%80%E7%A7%9F%E4%BA%8B%E5%AE%9C-%E6%B1%9F%E6%B9%96%E8%B7%AF%E8%BF%9C-%E6%9C%89%E7%BC%98%E5%86%8D%E8%A7%81)

The end of a grand party in the world, just as it is for renting. When the lease ends or due to changes in work or personal reasons, we have to say goodbye to the house we've been living in for so long. The process of vacating, though seemingly simple, has its nuances, and mishandling it can lead to disputes. Therefore, we need to prepare ahead of time to ensure a smooth departure, return the deposit, and say goodbye perfectly.

3.1.1 Informing the landlord beforehand: Goodbye with goodbyes, no regrets [](https://zufang.ababtools.com/s9#_3-1-1-%E6%8F%90%E5%89%8D%E5%91%8A%E7%9F%A5%E6%88%BF%E4%B8%9C-%E5%A5%BD%E8%81%9A%E5%A5%BD%E6%95%A3-%E4%B8%8D%E7%95%99%E9%81%97%E6%86%BE)

First, we need to follow the  rules and inform the landlord beforehand with an intention to vacate. Generally, the contract will specify how much notice you should give the landlord—typically one month, or 15 or 45 days, depending on the contract terms. If there’s no specific clause, it’s best to notify at least one month in advance—it’s basic courtesy and ensures the landlord has time to find a new tenant. The notification can be done in person, via phone, SMS, or WeChat—but to avoid any disputes later, it’s better to send it electronically, like an SMS or WeChat message, leaving evidence.

3.1.2 Clean out the room: Load light, bid fair farewell to old life [](https://zufang.ababtools.com/s9#_3-1-2-%E6%B8%85%E7%90%86%E6%88%BF%E9%97%B4-%E8%BD%BB%E8%A3%85%E4%B8%8A%E9%98%B5-%E5%91%8A%E5%88%AB%E6%97%A7%E7%94%9F%E6%B4%BB)

After informing the landlord, we need to start cleaning out the room. After so long in the house, there must be a lot of stuff lying around—time to get rid of
