| Rental Period | The maximum term is 20 years; after signing, it can be renewed, but the total term cannot exceed 20 years. | Plan your term carefully—too short may cause instability, too long may limit flexibility. |
| Rent Payment | Clarify payment terms and amounts, such as paying one month's rent in advance or two months' rent. | Ensure fairness; do not pay more than you can afford. |
| Repair Responsibilities | Generally, the landlord is responsible for maintaining the main structure of the property, while the tenant covers daily maintenance costs. | Include these details in the contract to avoid disputes. |
| Default Clauses | Rules for handling cases like returning early or defaulting on rent payments. | Ensure the penalty is reasonable; do not be taken advantage of. |
