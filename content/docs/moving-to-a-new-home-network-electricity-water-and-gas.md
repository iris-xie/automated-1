------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---

### **1. Choosing an Operator:**

The main broadband operators are China Mobile, China Unicom, and China Telecom. Mobile and Unicom often provide affordable packages with flexible contract terms, which can be ideal for renters. Choose based on local network stability, price, and your usage needs.

---

### **2. Applying for Broadband:**

You can apply via WeChat official accounts, mini-programs, or the mobile app of your chosen operator, or by visiting a local service center. Many operators now offer "standalone broadband" plans that do not require bundling with a phone number.

---

### **3. Selecting a Package:**

Broadband packages typically range from 100 Mbps to 1000 Mbps. For everyday browsing and streaming, 200–300 Mbps is usually sufficient. Gamers and streamers may prefer 500–1000 Mbps plans.

### **4. Installation and Equipment:**

After submitting your application, a technician will install and activate your service. They will connect and configure the fiber modem (ONT) and your router to ensure a stable connection. If router setup is not included, consider purchasing a reliable router separately.

Now, utility bills can be paid online through platforms like WeChat or Alipay, or you can hand-deliver the bill to designated collection points at the service center.

2. Payment Deadlines:  
- *Maintenance Fees:* Typically due upon signing the lease agreement. If there is a waiver of maintenance fees, there is no need to worry about this.  
- *Gas Fees:* Usually paid quarterly. You can pay online or visit the service center for both online and offline payment options.  
- *Electricity Fees:* Typically billed monthly, with account statements arriving between the 1st and the 10th of each month. The exact billing date may vary locally; please check with your electricity company or customer service.
