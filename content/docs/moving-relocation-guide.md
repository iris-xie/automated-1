**Newly Renovated Housing and Moving Guide**

Moving is a significant undertaking that requires careful preparation. Before moving, ensure your belongings are organized to avoid loss or damage during the process.

2.1 Pre-moving Preparation

* Packaging large items: For sending large goods, use ’s official WeChat  or app to place orders with  for on-site delivery. Prices are reasonable if the package weighs no more than 30kg or 50kg; make sure not to overstate the weight.
* Plan routes: Anticipate traffic and choose non-busy roads to save time.

**2. Clean and Organize Items:**

* The 3Q rule: Discard unnecessary, old, or broken items to lighten your load and free up space.
* Categorization: Sort items by room (e.g., living area, bedroom) and bundle them for easier relocation.
* Protection of fragile items: Use bubble wrap, paper, etc., to wrap porcelain items like cups, bowls, vases to prevent damage during moving.
* Packaging tools: Prepare boxes, bags, tape, scissors, pens, markers, etc., for packaging. Use medium-sized boxes (60cm x 40cm x 50cm) for clothes and furniture; small boxes (30cm x 20cm x 30cm) for smaller items.

**3. Moving Before Check-in:**

* Take photos of all room corners before moving in to serve as proof of occupancy for future disputes.
* Document everything meticulously to avoid issues upon return.

**4. Moving Tips:**

* Lighter items should go into small boxes, while heavier ones should be packed in larger boxes to prevent squishing.
